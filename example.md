R Markdown
----------

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting
syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details
on using R Markdown see
<a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com" class="uri">http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com</a>.  
There also is a cheatsheet, see
<a href="https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf" class="uri">https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf</a>.

Please submit your presentation/poster in markdown as it will enable
blind people to use screen reading software or braille displays to
follow the details (e.g. code) of talks.

Requirements
------------

-   Length:
    -   contributed: 10-15 minutes
    -   lightning: 3-5 minutes
    -   poster: 0.5-1 minute
-   Video should be picture in picture (slides in the background,
    speaker smaller in the foreground), or slides and speaker should be
    on splitted screens.
-   Please let us know if your video requires a content warning
    (e.g. due to unavoidable presentation of offensive or sexualised
    material, or due to flashing images).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Video of the speaker

-   Best would be a neutral background and low or no background audio.
-   Your face should be clearly visible (people who are deaf or hard of
    hearing may be able to lip-read).
-   Speak clearly.
-   Please pace yourself, so the audience can integrate both audio and
    visual information. Graphics, pictures, videos, and memes should be
    described audibly.
-   Speak every word on a slide, read long excerpts aloud.
-   Verbally describe images.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Slides

-   Use large sans serif fonts (as a guide 28-32pt or above for regular
    text).
-   Use high contrast.
-   Make sure slides are discernable for color blind users.
-   Use more than color to communicate information (color coding cannot
    be understood by people who are blind or colorblind).
-   Do not use flashing videos or images.
-   Avoid using animations (Unless with a detailed audio description).
-   Provide a text equivalent for graphics, but not for graphics that
    are only meant for decoration.
